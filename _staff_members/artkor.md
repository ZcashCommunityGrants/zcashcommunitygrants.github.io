Artkor has been an active member of the Zcash community since 2018, authoring the blog pro.zcash.ru and YouTube channel @prozcash, while supporting the Russian-speaking Zcash community on social media. Starting as a GPU miner, he later transitioned to blockchain data analysis, realizing that the lack of privacy in public networks could hinder cryptocurrency adoption for payments. This inspired him to promote Zcash as a cryptocurrency aligned with his vision of privacy and security for individuals and businesses. With experience in business, government, and investment consulting, Artkor brings expertise in capital efficiency and strategic planning. His commitment to Zcashâ€™s success is unwavering, driven by a passion for creating long-term value for ZEC and its ecosystem.
