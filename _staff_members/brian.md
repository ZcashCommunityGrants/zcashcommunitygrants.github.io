Brian has been a supporter and follower of the crypto asset ecosystem for 8 years and is a former miner of multiple cryptocurrencies to include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. Brian's excitement for the Zcash ecosystem is rooted in his understanding of the importance of privacy in the digital economy. Intrigued by Zcash when he discovered the project in 2017, he participated in the Powers of Tau multi-party computation ceremony and has watched the project mature ever since. He is very excited to support the ecosystem as a Major Grant Review Committee member and is looking forward to approving high quality grants that bring growth and usability improvements in the coming years and further decentralize development within the Zcash ecosystem.
