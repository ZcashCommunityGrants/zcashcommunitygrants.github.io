## Develop

Urban was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](https://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
