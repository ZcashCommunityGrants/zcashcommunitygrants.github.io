Jason McGee spent 15 years working in finance and accounting, most recently as the Head of Operations for a hedge fund in NYC. He left his job in 2017 to focus on crypto full time and currently works as an independent trader and investor. McGee first discovered Zcash in mid 2017, and more recently has become an active member in the Zcash community. In 2021, he led discussions on how to improve Zcash Community Grants' organizational structure, which ultimately resulted in an amendment to ZIP 1014 to provide the grants committee a discretionary budget. McGee also serves as a moderator for the Zcash Community on Telegram. He is excited to join Zcash Community Grants as a committee member and looks forward to funding projects that bring more users to Zcash and add more utility and value to ZEC.
